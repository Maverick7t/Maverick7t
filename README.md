### 👨‍💻 About Me
![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Maverick7t&label=Profile%20Views&color=0e75b6&style=flat)

I live in Bengaluru, India. I like building things that work, scale, and occasionally talk back.

My work floats somewhere between data engineering, machine learning, automation, and whatever else needs fixing. I chase clean systems, sharp logic, and problems worth solving.

> Not a perfectionist, just allergic to lazy fixes 🤧.
