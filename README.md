### 👨‍💻 About Me
![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Maverick7t&label=Profile%20Views&color=0e75b6&style=flat)

I live in Banglore, India 
### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Moinaktar — a data-native engineer with one stubborn mission:  
**Build the closest thing to JARVIS.**

While most people fine-tune models, I build the pipeline, clean the chaos, engineer the logic, and deploy the system. I don’t stop at predictions — I chase intelligence that thinks, adapts, and talks back.

💡 If you gave me $1M today, I’d build an AGI that understands context, acts on intent, and gets things done like a personal operating system for the mind. Not in theory — in code.

My tools?  
- Clean, traceable data  
- Scalable infrastructure  
- Machine learning that doesn't just guess — it learns with purpose

And yeah, I don’t move past bugs. I break them, debug them, and automate the fix.

> I don’t just want to work in AI. I want to build the brains behind it.
